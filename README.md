# FeedEater

A lightweight RSS feed aggregator built with Nuxt, deployed on NuxtHub, and integrated with Cloudflare to provide a free, on-the-fly RSS reader.

## Features

Here are the key features of the application:

- [ ] Support for RSS and ATOM formats
- [ ] Compatibility with mobile screens
- [ ] Management of feeds through a single plaintext file
- [ ] Tag-based categorization of feeds
- [ ] Customizable feed names and colors
- [ ] Scheduled feed fetching

## Limitations

The following potential features are not included in this application and are not part of the planned roadmap.

- No built-in authentication or authorization
- No user management system
- No feed management UI

## Low maintenance project

This is a low-maintenance project with a deliberately narrow scope of features and support to ensure long-term viability. I have no plans to expand this into a larger project.

Bug-related issues and PRs are welcome as long as they do not significantly broaden the project's scope.

Please refrain from submitting PRs for new features that expand the scope.
